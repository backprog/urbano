## **Urbano** ##

Urbano is a Node.js framework fully written in ES6. It doesn't use any compiler to transpile your code to ES5. Your code will stay as it is. 
It means that only a Node.js 6.5.0+ server can run it. Annoying ? Not really. There's no need to be stuck with older Node.js versions to write new projects. New ES6 features allowed to build a real OOP MVC framework, that uses dependencies injection and singletons. It opens too, new ways to handle async/sync issues.
